# Project Advanced Multimedia Applications
## Description
**Notebooks and data science: interactive analytics in the cloud** is a project for the Advanced Multimedia Applications course (2016). 

The goal of this project is to integrate Google Cloud Datalab into Datatonic's A3S framework for uploading and processing Big Data. [Datatonic](http://datatonic.com/) wants to extend the frameworks functionality with notebook support, hosted in the cloud to allow easy sharing, and to provide the possibility of creating and sharing multiple views.
