## Front-end node server
This directory contains the code for the node.js proof-of-concept server. 
The server offers functionality to deploy our custom datalab version locally or on the Google Cloud Platform.
It informs the user of the status of the deployments and allows the user to retrieve notebooks, see if there are sessions running and shut down these sessions if wanted.

### Deployment
To set up the `auto-deployment-server`, it suffices to enter its directory and use the following command to run the server:
```
node bin/www
```
The deployment server runs now locally at: ```http://localhost:3000```.  
More info can be found on the deployment [wiki page](https://github.com/brecht-d-m/amma-bda/wiki/Deployment)

### Code architecture
The code uses a codebase generated by the express framework. We have modified following files to implement functionality:
  *  ```app.js ```: schedule status checks for deployments, logic for handling client connections and events
  *   ```bin/notebook_retriever.js ```: on event of client requesting notebooks, get notebooks from deployment and transmit them
  *  ```public/* ```: CSS style, images and user side javascript for handling events transmission & reception
  *  ```routes/index.js ```: has a lot of code relating to deployment, which uses POST requests
  *  ```views/* ```: jade files that describe the html to render
